# Election-analysis

## Project Overview
Client will like an election audit of the tabulated results for US congressional precinct in Colorado. Analysis requested to report the total number of votes cast, the total number of votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes for each candidate and the winner of the election based on the popular vote. This task is usually done in Excel but our client would like to automate the process using Python. A successful audit will allow our client to use the code for other congressional districts, senatorial districts and local elections.

1.	Total number of votes cast
2.	A complete list of candidates who received votes
3.	Total number of votes each candidate received
